Hello! 

Thank you for taking the time to survey my code. 
My name is Lyla, I have been a developer since August of 2024. 
This code was created mostly by myself, with the help of online resources.

I am very much into design and artwork, which is why I tended to get quite creative with this project.

Please bare in mind, this is my first professional project in which I would like to showcase this to hiring managers, and those alike. 

If you are interested in working with me, please follow me via LinkedIn: Lyla Roberts.

Thank you!
